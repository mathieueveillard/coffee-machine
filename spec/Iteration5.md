# Iteration 5

Despite all the efforts to anticipate, shortages still happen (tea, coffee, chocolate, water, milk, sugarâ€¦). Your product owner wants you to take advantage of the machine capabilities to inform the user that there is a shortage and to send a email notification to the company so that they can come and refill the machine.

## Use cases

- When I order a drink and it can be delivered because of a shortage, I want to see a message to the coffee machine console that indicates me the shortage and that a notification has been sent.

## Implementation details

You can take advantages of the 2 services implemented by the coffee machine:

```typescript
beverageQuantityChecker(drink: Drink): Promise<boolean>;
```

```typescript
notifyMissingDrink(drink: Drink): Promise<void>;
```

## Congrats!

You're done!
